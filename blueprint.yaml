description: |
  A comprehensive asset tracking solution that includes location services, various power modes, and extensive configuration capabilities. 

  Key Features:
  - Real-Time Event Publishing: Publishes location on movement events, high-G events, and boundary crossings.
  - Location and Diagnostics: Publishes satellite count and signal metrics for GNSS health. Enhanced location tracking with features like geofencing, circular zones, and high-accuracy GNSS data for both speed and lock stability.
  - Battery and Power Management: Optimized battery state-of-charge accuracy, shutdown current, and configurable power modes. Includes control over battery charge limits based on operating temperatures to extend device life.
  - Storage and Data Persistence: Store-and-forward feature enables data retention while offline, with reliable data uploads once connectivity is restored.
  - Cloud Configuration: Includes cloud-configurable settings for various aspects like GNSS dead reckoning, power settings, and publish rates.
  - Tracking in Extreme Conditions: Accurate tracking in poor conditions, sleep modes to conserve power, and configurable publish rates based on movement or location triggers.
  - Device Health and Diagnostics: Built-in support for the Memfault platform for advanced device monitoring and diagnostics, as well as detailed event logging.
